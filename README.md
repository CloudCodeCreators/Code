# Post_check_CVE-2025-53786_mitigation.ps1
## Purpose
This week was a lot of fun in patching several Exchange environments in regards to CVE-2025-53786. The HCW was executed with the new option to configure a dedicated Exchange hybrid application in Microsoft Entra ID. As a final step, the cleanup script was fired but we noticed that there was not a lot of output regarding certificates and additional info. So we quickly created a script that checks the older shared service principal and also the newly created dedicated Exchange hybrid application in Microsoft Entra ID.

If you manage Exchange hybrid deployments, itâ€™s worth validating service principals and certificates after automated changes, a quick verification script can save hours of troubleshooting. Happy to share the script or walk through the checks.

## What It Does
- Connects to Microsoft Graph for your chosen tenant (supports UPN, tenant domain, or custom domain input)
- Checks both App Registration and Service Principal for Exchange Online ("Office 365 Exchange Online")
- Lists and validates all certificates and client secrets, highlighting expired or missing credentials
- Generates a detailed HTML report for your records

## Why Use This Script?
This is a rapid assessment tool to help admins quickly check if their tenant is potentially impacted by CVE-2025-53786. It does not remediate, but gives clear visibility into certificate status for Exchange Online identities.

## Usage
1. Run the script in PowerShell with the required Microsoft Graph permissions (Application.Read.All).
2. Follow the prompts to select your tenant.
3. Review the on-screen results and the generated HTML report.

> **Note:** This script is for validation only. Always review official Microsoft guidance for mitigation steps.
